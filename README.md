# Bookstore
The bookstore application has been used to validate multiple test suite reduction methods for user-session based testing. This code was previously accessible at www.gotocode.com, but this website is not available anymore.
Some papers in which this application has been used:
- Sreedevi Sampath, Sara Sprenkle, Emily Gibson, Lori Pollock, and Amie Souter Greenwald. Applying concept analysis to user-session-based testing of web applications. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 33(10), 2007.
